# Troubleshooting Amazon API Gateway identity
and access
Use the following information to help you diagnose and fix common issues that you might
encounter when working with API Gateway and IAM.

perform an action in API Gateway](#security_iam_troubleshoot-no-permissions)

## I am not authorized to
perform an action in API Gateway
If you receive an error that you're not authorized to perform an action, your
policies must be updated to allow you to perform the action.
The following example error occurs when the `mateojackson` IAM user
tries to use the console to view details about a fictional
``my-example-widget`` resource but doesn't
have the fictional `apigateway:`GetWidget`` permissions.
```
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/mateojackson is not authorized to perform: apigateway:`GetWidget` on resource: `my-example-widget` because no identity-based policy allows the `GetWidget` action
```
In this case, the policy for the `mateojackson` user must be updated to allow access to the
``my-example-widget`` resource by using the
`apigateway:`GetWidget`` action.
If you need help, contact your AWS administrator. Your administrator is the person who provided you with your sign-in credentials.
## I am not authorized to perform
iam:PassRole
If you receive an error that you're not authorized to perform the `iam:PassRole` action, your policies must be updated to allow you to pass a role to API Gateway.
Some AWS services allow you to pass an existing role to that service instead of creating a new service role or service-linked role. To do
this, you must have permissions to pass the role to the service.
The following example error occurs when an IAM user named `marymajor` tries to use the console to perform an action in
API Gateway. However, the action requires the service to have permissions that are granted by a service role. Mary does not have permissions to pass the
role to the service.
```
`User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/`marymajor` is not authorized to perform: iam:PassRole`
```
In this case, Mary's policies must be updated to allow her to perform the `iam:PassRole` action.
If you need help, contact your AWS administrator. Your administrator is the person who provided you with your sign-in credentials.
## I want to allow people
outside of my AWS account to access my API Gateway resources
You can create a role that users in other accounts or people outside of your organization can use to access your resources. You can specify who
is trusted to assume the role. For services that support resource-based policies or access control lists (ACLs), you can use those policies to grant
people access to your resources.
To learn more, consult the following:
* To learn whether API Gateway supports these features, see [How Amazon API Gateway works with
IAM](./security_iam_service-with-iam.html).
* To learn how to provide access to your resources across AWS accounts that you own, see [Providing access to an IAM user in another AWS account that you
own](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_aws-accounts.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
* To learn how to provide access to your resources to third-party AWS accounts, see [Providing access to AWS accounts owned by third parties](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_third-party.html) in the
*IAM User Guide*.
* To learn how to provide access through identity federation, see [Providing access to externally authenticated users (identity federation)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_federated-users.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
* To learn the difference between using roles and resource-based policies for cross-account access, see [Cross account resource access in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies-cross-account-resource-access.html) in the
*IAM User Guide*.
