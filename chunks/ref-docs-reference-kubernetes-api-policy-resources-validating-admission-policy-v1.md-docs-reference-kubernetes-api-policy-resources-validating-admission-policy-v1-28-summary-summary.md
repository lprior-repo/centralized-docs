* **spec.matchConstraints.excludeResourceRules.resources** ([]string)
*Atomic: will be replaced during a merge*
Resources is a list of resources this rule applies to.
For example: 'pods' means pods. 'pods/log' means the log subresource of pods. '*' means all resources, but not subresources. 'pods/*' means all subresources of pods. '*/scale' means all scale subresources. '*/\*' means all resources and their subresources.
If wildcard is present, the validation rule will ensure resources do not overlap with each other.
