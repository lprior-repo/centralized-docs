### User exposed information
When Pod P preempts one or more Pods on Node N, `nominatedNodeName` field of Pod
P's status is set to the name of Node N. This field helps the scheduler track
resources reserved for Pod P and also gives users information about preemptions
in their clusters.
Please note that Pod P is not necessarily scheduled to the "nominated Node".
The scheduler always tries the "nominated Node" before iterating over any other nodes.
After victim Pods are preempted, they get their graceful termination period. If
another node becomes available while scheduler is waiting for the victim Pods to
terminate, scheduler may use the other node to schedule Pod P. As a result
`nominatedNodeName` and `nodeName` of Pod spec are not always the same. Also, if
the scheduler preempts Pods on Node N, but then a higher priority Pod than Pod P
arrives, the scheduler may give Node N to the new higher priority Pod. In such a
case, scheduler clears `nominatedNodeName` of Pod P. By doing this, scheduler
makes Pod P eligible to preempt Pods on another Node.
#### Graceful termination of preemption victims
When Pods are preempted, the victims get their
[graceful termination period](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-termination).
They have that much time to finish their work and exit. If they don't, they are
killed. This graceful termination period creates a time gap between the point
that the scheduler preempts Pods and the time when the pending Pod (P) can be
scheduled on the Node (N). In the meantime, the scheduler keeps scheduling other
pending Pods. As victims exit or get terminated, the scheduler tries to schedule
Pods in the pending queue. Therefore, there is usually a time gap between the
point that scheduler preempts victims and the time that Pod P is scheduled. In
order to minimize this gap, one can set graceful termination period of lower
priority Pods to zero or a small number.
#### PodDisruptionBudget is supported, but not guaranteed
A [PodDisruptionBudget](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/) (PDB)
allows application owners to limit the number of Pods of a replicated application
that are down simultaneously from voluntary disruptions. Kubernetes supports
PDB when preempting Pods, but respecting PDB is best effort. The scheduler tries
to find victims whose PDB are not violated by preemption, but if no such victims
are found, preemption will still happen, and lower priority Pods will be removed
despite their PDBs being violated.
#### Inter-Pod affinity on lower-priority Pods
A Node is considered for preemption only when the answer to this question is
yes: "If all the Pods with lower priority than the pending Pod are removed from
the Node, can the pending Pod be scheduled on the Node?"
#### Note:
Preemption does not necessarily remove all lower-priority
Pods. If the pending Pod can be scheduled by removing fewer than all
lower-priority Pods, then only a portion of the lower-priority Pods are removed.
Even so, the answer to the preceding question must be yes. If the answer is no,
the Node is not considered for preemption.
If a pending Pod has inter-pod [affinity](/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity)
to one or more of the lower-priority Pods on the Node, the inter-Pod affinity
rule cannot be satisfied in the absence of those lower-priority Pods. In this case,
the scheduler does not preempt any Pods on the Node. Instead, it looks for another
Node. The scheduler might find a suitable Node or it might not. There is no
guarantee that the pending Pod can be scheduled.
Our recommended solution for this problem is to create inter-Pod affinity only
towards equal or higher priority Pods.
