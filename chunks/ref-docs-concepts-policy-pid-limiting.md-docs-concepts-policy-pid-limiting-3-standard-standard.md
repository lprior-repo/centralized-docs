## Node PID limits
Kubernetes allows you to reserve a number of process IDs for the system use. To
configure the reservation, use the parameter `pid=&lt;number&gt;` in the
`--system-reserved` and `--kube-reserved` command line options to the kubelet.
The value you specified declares that the specified number of process IDs will
be reserved for the system as a whole and for Kubernetes system daemons
respectively.
## Pod PID limits
Kubernetes allows you to limit the number of processes running in a Pod. You
specify this limit at the node level, rather than configuring it as a resource
limit for a particular Pod. Each Node can have a different PID limit.
To configure the limit, you can specify the command line parameter `--pod-max-pids`
to the kubelet, or set `PodPidsLimit` in the kubelet
[configuration file](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubelet-config-file/).
## PID based eviction
You can configure kubelet to start terminating a Pod when it is misbehaving and consuming abnormal amount of resources.
This feature is called eviction. You can
[Configure Out of Resource Handling](/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/node-pressure-eviction/)
for various eviction signals.
Use `pid.available` eviction signal to configure the threshold for number of PIDs used by Pod.
You can set soft and hard eviction policies.
However, even with the hard eviction policy, if the number of PIDs growing very fast,
node can still get into unstable state by hitting the node PIDs limit.
Eviction signal value is calculated periodically and does NOT enforce the limit.
PID limiting - per Pod and per Node sets the hard limit.
Once the limit is hit, workload will start experiencing failures when trying to get a new PID.
It may or may not lead to rescheduling of a Pod,
depending on how workload reacts on these failures and how liveness and readiness
probes are configured for the Pod. However, if limits were set correctly,
you can guarantee that other Pods workload and system processes will not run out of PIDs
when one Pod is misbehaving.
