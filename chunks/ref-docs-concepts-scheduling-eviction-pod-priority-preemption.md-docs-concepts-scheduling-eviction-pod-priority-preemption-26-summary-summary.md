When Pods are created, they go to a queue and wait to be scheduled. The
scheduler picks a Pod from the queue and tries to schedule it on a Node. If no
Node is found that satisfies all the specified requirements of the Pod,

Preemption logic tries to find a Node where removal of one or more Pods with
lower priority than P would enable P to be scheduled on that Node. If such a
Node is found, one or more lower priority Pods get evicted from the Node. After
