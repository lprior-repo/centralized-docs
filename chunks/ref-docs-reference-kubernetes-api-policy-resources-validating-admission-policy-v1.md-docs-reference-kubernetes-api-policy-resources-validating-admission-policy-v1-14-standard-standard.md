* 'set': `X + Y` performs a union where the array positions of all elements in `X` are preserved and
non-intersecting elements in `Y` are appended, retaining their partial order.
* 'map': `X + Y` performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in `X` are preserved but the values
are overwritten by values in `Y` when the key sets of `X` and `Y` intersect. Elements in `Y` with
non-intersecting keys are appended, retaining their partial order.
Required.
* **spec.validations.message** (string)
Message represents the message displayed when validation fails. The message is required if the Expression contains line breaks. The message must not contain line breaks. If unset, the message is "failed rule: {Rule}". e.g. "must be a URL with the host matching spec.host" If the Expression contains line breaks. Message is required. The message must not contain line breaks. If unset, the message is "failed Expression: {Expression}".
* **spec.validations.messageExpression** (string)
messageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails. Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string. If both message and messageExpression are present on a validation, then messageExpression will be used if validation fails. If messageExpression results in a runtime error, the runtime error is logged, and the validation failure message is produced as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset, and the fact that messageExpression produced an empty string/string with only spaces/string with line breaks will be logged. messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the `expression` except for 'authorizer' and 'authorizer.requestResource'. Example: "object.x must be less than max ("+string(params.max)+")"
