# Weave Net for NetworkPolicy
This page shows how to use Weave Net for NetworkPolicy.
## Before you begin
You need to have a Kubernetes cluster. Follow the
[kubeadm getting started guide](/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/) to bootstrap one.
## Install the Weave Net addon
Follow the [Integrating Kubernetes via the Addon](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/blob/master/site/kubernetes/kube-addon.md#-installation) guide.
The Weave Net addon for Kubernetes comes with a
[Network Policy Controller](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/blob/master/site/kubernetes/kube-addon.md#network-policy)
that automatically monitors Kubernetes for any NetworkPolicy annotations on all
namespaces and configures `iptables` rules to allow or block traffic as directed by the policies.
## Test the installation
Verify that the weave works.
Enter the following command:
```
`kubectl get pods -n kube-system -o wide
`
```
The output is similar to this:
```
`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE
weave-net-1t1qg 2/2 Running 0 9d 192.168.2.10 worknode3
weave-net-231d7 2/2 Running 1 7d 10.2.0.17 worknodegpu
weave-net-7nmwt 2/2 Running 3 9d 192.168.2.131 masternode
weave-net-pmw8w 2/2 Running 0 9d 192.168.2.216 worknode2
`
```
Each Node has a weave Pod, and all Pods are `Running` and `2/2 READY`. (`2/2` means that each Pod has `weave` and `weave-npc`.)
## What's next
Once you have installed the Weave Net addon, you can follow the
[Declare Network Policy](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/declare-network-policy/)
to try out Kubernetes NetworkPolicy. If you have any question, contact us at
[#weave-community on Slack or Weave User Group](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave#getting-help).
