## What's next
* [kubeadm init](/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-init/) to bootstrap a Kubernetes control-plane node
* [kubeadm join](/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-join/) to connect a node to the cluster
* [kubeadm reset](/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-reset/) to revert any changes made to this host by `kubeadm init` or `kubeadm join`
* [kubeadm upgrade](/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-upgrade/) to upgrade a kubeadm node
* [kubeadm alpha](/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-alpha/) to try experimental functionality
