* **spec.matchConstraints** (MatchResources)
MatchConstraints specifies what resources this policy is designed to validate. The AdmissionPolicy cares about a request if it matches *all* Constraints. However, in order to prevent clusters from being put into an unstable state that cannot be recovered from via the API ValidatingAdmissionPolicy cannot match ValidatingAdmissionPolicy and ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding. Required.
*MatchResources decides whether to run the admission control policy on an object based on whether it meets the match criteria. The exclude rules take precedence over include rules (if a resource matches both, it is excluded)*
* **spec.matchConstraints.excludeResourceRules** ([]NamedRuleWithOperations)
*Atomic: will be replaced during a merge*
ExcludeResourceRules describes what operations on what resources/subresources the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy should not care about. The exclude rules take precedence over include rules (if a resource matches both, it is excluded)
*NamedRuleWithOperations is a tuple of Operations and Resources with ResourceNames.*
* **spec.matchConstraints.excludeResourceRules.apiGroups** ([]string)
*Atomic: will be replaced during a merge*
APIGroups is the API groups the resources belong to. '*' is all groups. If '*' is present, the length of the slice must be one. Required.
* **spec.matchConstraints.excludeResourceRules.apiVersions** ([]string)
*Atomic: will be replaced during a merge*
APIVersions is the API versions the resources belong to. '*' is all versions. If '*' is present, the length of the slice must be one. Required.
* **spec.matchConstraints.excludeResourceRules.operations** ([]string)
*Atomic: will be replaced during a merge*
Operations is the operations the admission hook cares about - CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, CONNECT or \* for all of those operations and any future admission operations that are added. If '\*' is present, the length of the slice must be one. Required.
* **spec.matchConstraints.excludeResourceRules.resourceNames** ([]string)
*Atomic: will be replaced during a merge*
ResourceNames is an optional white list of names that the rule applies to. An empty set means that everything is allowed.
