### User-facing roles
Some of the default ClusterRoles are not `system:` prefixed. These are intended to be user-facing roles.
They include super-user roles (`cluster-admin`), roles intended to be granted cluster-wide
using ClusterRoleBindings, and roles intended to be granted within particular
namespaces using RoleBindings (`admin`, `edit`, `view`).
User-facing ClusterRoles use [ClusterRole aggregation](#aggregated-clusterroles) to allow admins to include
rules for custom resources on these ClusterRoles. To add rules to the `admin`, `edit`, or `view` roles, create
a ClusterRole with one or more of the following labels:
```
`metadata:
labels:
rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-admin: "true"
rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-edit: "true"
rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-view: "true"
`
```
