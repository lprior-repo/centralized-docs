## Before you begin
You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must
be configured to communicate with your cluster. It is recommended to run this tutorial on a cluster with at least two nodes that are not acting as control plane hosts. If you do not already have a
cluster, you can create one by using
[minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tutorials/multi_node/)
or you can use one of these Kubernetes playgrounds:
* [iximiuz Labs](https://labs.iximiuz.com/playgrounds?category=kubernetes&amp;filter=all)
* [Killercoda](https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/kubernetes)
* [KodeKloud](https://kodekloud.com/public-playgrounds)
Your cluster must be configured to use the CoreDNS
[addon](/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/) or its precursor,
kube-dns.
Your Kubernetes server must be at or later than version v1.6.
To check the version, enter `kubectl version`.
