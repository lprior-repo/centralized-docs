Hook delivery is intended to be *at least once*,
which means that a hook may be called multiple times for any given event,
such as for `PostStart` or `PreStop`.
It is up to the hook implementation to handle this correctly.
Generally, only single deliveries are made.
If, for example, an HTTP hook receiver is down and is unable to take traffic,
there is no attempt to resend.
In some rare cases, however, double delivery may occur.
For instance, if a kubelet restarts in the middle of sending a hook,
the hook might be resent after the kubelet comes back up.
