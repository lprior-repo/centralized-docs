#### Warning:
The Kubernetes project recommends against this approach (configuring all component instances
with custom IP addresses). Instead, the Kubernetes maintainers recommend to setup the host network,
so that the default gateway IP is the one that Kubernetes components auto-detect and use.
On Linux nodes, you can use commands such as `ip route` to configure networking; your operating
system might also provide higher level network management tools. If your node's default gateway
is a public IP address, you should configure packet filtering or other security measures that
protect the nodes and your cluster.
