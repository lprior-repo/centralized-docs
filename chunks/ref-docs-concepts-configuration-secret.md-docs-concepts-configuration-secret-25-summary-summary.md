Consider a program that needs to handle HTTP requests, do some complex business
logic, and then sign some messages with an HMAC. Because it has complex
application logic, there might be an unnoticed remote file reading exploit in
the server, which could expose the private key to an attacker.
This could be divided into two processes in two containers: a frontend container
which handles user interaction and business logic, but which cannot see the
private key; and a signer container that can see the private key, and responds
to simple signing requests from the frontend (for example, over localhost networking).
