number of Pods from ordinal 0 through N-1 are alive and ready. StatefulSet ensures that, at any time,
there is at most one Pod with a given identity running in a cluster. This is referred to as
*at most one* semantics provided by a StatefulSet.
Manual force deletion should be undertaken with caution, as it has the potential to violate the
at most one semantics inherent to StatefulSet. StatefulSets may be used to run distributed and
clustered applications which have a need for a stable network identity and stable storage.
