* **webhooks.objectSelector** ([LabelSelector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/common-definitions/label-selector/#LabelSelector))
ObjectSelector decides whether to run the webhook based on if the object has matching labels. objectSelector is evaluated against both the oldObject and newObject that would be sent to the webhook, and is considered to match if either object matches the selector. A null object (oldObject in the case of create, or newObject in the case of delete) or an object that cannot have labels (like a DeploymentRollback or a PodProxyOptions object) is not considered to match. Use the object selector only if the webhook is opt-in, because end users may skip the admission webhook by setting the labels. Default to the empty LabelSelector, which matches everything.
* **webhooks.rules** ([]RuleWithOperations)
*Atomic: will be replaced during a merge*
Rules describes what operations on what resources/subresources the webhook cares about. The webhook cares about an operation if it matches *any* Rule. However, in order to prevent ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks and MutatingAdmissionWebhooks from putting the cluster in a state which cannot be recovered from without completely disabling the plugin, ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks and MutatingAdmissionWebhooks are never called on admission requests for ValidatingWebhookConfiguration and MutatingWebhookConfiguration objects.
*RuleWithOperations is a tuple of Operations and Resources. It is recommended to make sure that all the tuple expansions are valid.*
* **webhooks.rules.apiGroups** ([]string)
*Atomic: will be replaced during a merge*
APIGroups is the API groups the resources belong to. '*' is all groups. If '*' is present, the length of the slice must be one. Required.
* **webhooks.rules.apiVersions** ([]string)
*Atomic: will be replaced during a merge*
APIVersions is the API versions the resources belong to. '*' is all versions. If '*' is present, the length of the slice must be one. Required.
* **webhooks.rules.operations** ([]string)
*Atomic: will be replaced during a merge*
Operations is the operations the admission hook cares about - CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, CONNECT or \* for all of those operations and any future admission operations that are added. If '\*' is present, the length of the slice must be one. Required.
* **webhooks.rules.resources** ([]string)
*Atomic: will be replaced during a merge*
Resources is a list of resources this rule applies to.
For example: 'pods' means pods. 'pods/log' means the log subresource of pods. '*' means all resources, but not subresources. 'pods/*' means all subresources of pods. '*/scale' means all scale subresources. '*/\*' means all resources and their subresources.
If wildcard is present, the validation rule will ensure resources do not overlap with each other.
Depending on the enclosing object, subresources might not be allowed. Required.
* **webhooks.rules.scope** (string)
scope specifies the scope of this rule. Valid values are "Cluster", "Namespaced", and "*" "Cluster" means that only cluster-scoped resources will match this rule. Namespace API objects are cluster-scoped. "Namespaced" means that only namespaced resources will match this rule. "*" means that there are no scope restrictions. Subresources match the scope of their parent resource. Default is "\*".
Possible enum values:
* `"\*"` means that all scopes are included.
* `"Cluster"` means that scope is limited to cluster-scoped objects. Namespace objects are cluster-scoped.
* `"Namespaced"` means that scope is limited to namespaced objects.
* **webhooks.timeoutSeconds** (int32)
TimeoutSeconds specifies the timeout for this webhook. After the timeout passes, the webhook call will be ignored or the API call will fail based on the failure policy. The timeout value must be between 1 and 30 seconds. Default to 10 seconds.
