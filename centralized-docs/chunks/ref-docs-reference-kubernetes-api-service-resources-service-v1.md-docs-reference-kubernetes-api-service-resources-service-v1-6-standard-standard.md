* `"LoadBalancer"` means a service will be exposed via an external load balancer (if the cloud provider supports it), in addition to 'NodePort' type.
* `"NodePort"` means a service will be exposed on one port of every node, in addition to 'ClusterIP' type.

IPFamilies is a list of IP families (e.g. IPv4, IPv6) assigned to this service. This field is usually assigned automatically based on cluster configuration and the ipFamilyPolicy field. If this field is specified manually, the requested family is available in the cluster, and ipFamilyPolicy allows it, it will be used; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This field is conditionally mutable: it allows for adding or removing a secondary IP family, but it does not allow changing the primary IP family of the Service. Valid values are "IPv4" and "IPv6". This field only applies to Services of types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer, and does apply to "headless" services. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName.
This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack families, in either order). These families must correspond to the values of the clusterIPs field, if specified. Both clusterIPs and ipFamilies are governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field.
* **ipFamilyPolicy** (string)
IPFamilyPolicy represents the dual-stack-ness requested or required by this Service. If there is no value provided, then this field will be set to SingleStack. Services can be "SingleStack" (a single IP family), "PreferDualStack" (two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters or a single IP family on single-stack clusters), or "RequireDualStack" (two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters, otherwise fail). The ipFamilies and clusterIPs fields depend on the value of this field. This field will be wiped when updating a service to type ExternalName.
Possible enum values:
* `"PreferDualStack"` indicates that this service prefers dual-stack when the cluster is configured for dual-stack. If the cluster is not configured for dual-stack the service will be assigned a single IPFamily. If the IPFamily is not set in service.spec.ipFamilies then the service will be assigned the default IPFamily configured on the cluster
