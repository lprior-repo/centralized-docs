 is added to a node, then any pods that do
not tolerate the taint will be evicted immediately, and pods that do tolerate the
taint will never be evicted. However, a toleration with `NoExecute` effect can specify
an optional `tolerationSeconds` field that dictates how long the pod will stay bound
to the node after the taint is added. For example,
```
`tolerations:
- key: "key1"
operator: "Equal"
value: "value1"
effect: "NoExecute"
tolerationSeconds: 3600
`
```
