## Protecting cluster components from compromise
This section describes some common patterns for protecting clusters from compromise.
### Restrict access to etcd
Write access to the etcd backend for the API is equivalent to gaining root on the entire cluster,
and read access can be used to escalate fairly quickly. Administrators should always use strong
credentials from the API servers to their etcd server, such as mutual auth via TLS client certificates,
and it is often recommended to isolate the etcd servers behind a firewall that only the API servers
may access.
#### Caution:
Allowing other components within the cluster to access the master etcd instance with
read or write access to the full keyspace is equivalent to granting cluster-admin access. Using
separate etcd instances for non-master components or using etcd ACLs to restrict read and write
access to a subset of the keyspace is strongly recommended.
### Enable audit logging
The [audit logger](/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/audit/) is a beta feature that records actions taken by the
API for later analysis in the event of a compromise. It is recommended to enable audit logging
and archive the audit file on a secure server.
### Restrict access to alpha or beta features
Alpha and beta Kubernetes features are in active development and may have limitations or bugs
that result in security vulnerabilities. Always assess the value an alpha or beta feature may
provide against the possible risk to your security posture. When in doubt, disable features you
do not use.
### Rotate infrastructure credentials frequently
The shorter the lifetime of a secret or credential the harder it is for an attacker to make
use of that credential. Set short lifetimes on certificates and automate their rotation. Use
an authentication provider that can control how long issued tokens are available and use short
lifetimes where possible. If you use service-account tokens in external integrations, plan to
rotate those tokens frequently. For example, once the bootstrap phase is complete, a bootstrap
token used for setting up nodes should be revoked or its authorization removed.
