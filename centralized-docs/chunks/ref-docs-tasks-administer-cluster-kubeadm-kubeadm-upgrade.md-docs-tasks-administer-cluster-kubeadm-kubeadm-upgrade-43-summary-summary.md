`kubeadm-backup-manifests` contains a backup of the static Pod manifest files for this control plane Node.
In case of a upgrade failure and if the automatic rollback does not work, the contents of this folder can be
manually restored in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests`. If for some reason there is no difference between a pre-upgrade
and post-upgrade manifest file for a certain component, a backup file for it will not be written.
