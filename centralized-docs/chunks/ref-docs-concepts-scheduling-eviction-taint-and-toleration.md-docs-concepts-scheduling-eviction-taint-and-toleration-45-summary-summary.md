`node.kubernetes.io/not-ready` and `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable` taints.
If the fault condition returns to normal, the kubelet or node
controller can remove the relevant taint(s).
In some cases when the node is unreachable, the API server is unable to communicate
with the kubelet on the node. The decision to delete the pods cannot be communicated to
the kubelet until communication with the API server is re-established. In the meantime,
the pods that are scheduled for deletion may continue to run on the partitioned node.
