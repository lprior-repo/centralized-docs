## Configuring Pod schedulingGates
The `schedulingGates` field contains a list of strings, and each string literal is perceived as a
criteria that Pod should be satisfied before considered schedulable. This field can be initialized
only when a Pod is created (either by the client, or mutated during admission). After creation,
each schedulingGate can be removed in arbitrary order, but addition of a new scheduling gate is disallowed.
