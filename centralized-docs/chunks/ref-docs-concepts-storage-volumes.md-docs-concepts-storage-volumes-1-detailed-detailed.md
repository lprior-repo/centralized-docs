# Volumes
Kubernetes *volumes* provide a way for containers in a [Pod](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/)
to access and share data via the filesystem. There are different kinds of volume that you can use for different purposes,
such as:
* populating a configuration file based on a [ConfigMap](/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/)
or a [Secret](/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/)
* providing some temporary scratch space for a Pod
* sharing a filesystem between two different containers in the same Pod
* sharing a filesystem between two different Pods (even if those Pods run on different nodes)
* durably storing data so that it stays available even if the Pod restarts or is replaced
* passing configuration information to an app running in a container, based on details of the Pod
the container is in
(for example: telling a [sidecar container](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/)
what namespace the Pod is running in)
* providing read-only access to data in a different container image
Data sharing can be between different local processes within a container, or between different containers,
or between Pods.
## Why volumes are important
* **Data persistence:** On-disk files in a container are ephemeral, which presents some problems for
non-trivial applications when running in containers. One problem occurs when
a container crashes or is stopped; the container state is not saved, so all of the
files that were created or modified during the lifetime of the container are lost.
After a crash, kubelet restarts the container with a clean state.
* **Shared storage:** Another problem occurs when multiple containers are running in a `Pod` and
need to share files. It can be challenging to set up
and access a shared filesystem across all of the containers.
The Kubernetes [volume](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) abstraction
can help you to solve both of these problems.
Before you learn about volumes, PersistentVolumes, and PersistentVolumeClaims, you should read up
about [Pods](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) and make sure that you understand how
Kubernetes uses Pods to run containers.
## How volumes work
Kubernetes supports many types of volumes. A [Pod](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/)
can use any number of volume types simultaneously.
[Ephemeral volume](/docs/concepts/storage/ephemeral-volumes/) types have a lifetime linked to a specific Pod,
but [persistent volumes](/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) exist beyond
the lifetime of any individual Pod. When a Pod ceases to exist, Kubernetes destroys ephemeral volumes;
however, Kubernetes does not destroy persistent volumes.
For any kind of volume in a given Pod, data is preserved across container restarts.
At its core, a volume is a directory, possibly with some data in it, which
is accessible to the containers in a pod. How that directory comes to be, the
medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular
volume type used.
To use a volume, specify the volumes to provide for the Pod in `.spec.volumes`
and declare where to mount those volumes into containers in `.spec.containers[\*].volumeMounts`.
When a Pod is launched, a process in the container sees a filesystem view composed from the initial contents of
the [container image](/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-image), plus volumes
(if defined) mounted inside the container.
The process sees a root filesystem that initially matches the contents of the container image.
Any writes to within that filesystem hierarchy, if allowed, affect what that process views
when it performs a subsequent filesystem access.
Volumes are mounted at [specified paths](#using-subpath) within the container filesystem.
For each container defined within a Pod, you must independently specify where
to mount each volume that the container uses.
Volumes cannot mount within other volumes (but see [Using subPath](#using-subpath)
for a related mechanism). Also, a volume cannot contain a hard link to anything in
a different volume.
