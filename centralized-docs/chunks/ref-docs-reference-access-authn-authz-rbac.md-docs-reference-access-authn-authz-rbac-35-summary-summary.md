A role binding grants the permissions defined in a role to a user or set of users.
It holds a list of *subjects* (users, groups, or service accounts), and a reference to the
role being granted.
A RoleBinding grants permissions within a specific namespace whereas a ClusterRoleBinding
grants that access cluster-wide.
A RoleBinding may reference any Role in the same namespace. Alternatively, a RoleBinding
can reference a ClusterRole and bind that ClusterRole to the namespace of the RoleBinding.
If you want to bind a ClusterRole to all the namespaces in your cluster, you use a
ClusterRoleBinding.
