A RoleBinding can also reference a ClusterRole to grant the permissions defined in that
ClusterRole to resources inside the RoleBinding's namespace. This kind of reference

"dave" (the subject, case sensitive) will only be able to read Secrets in the "development"
namespace, because the RoleBinding's namespace (in its metadata) is "development".
