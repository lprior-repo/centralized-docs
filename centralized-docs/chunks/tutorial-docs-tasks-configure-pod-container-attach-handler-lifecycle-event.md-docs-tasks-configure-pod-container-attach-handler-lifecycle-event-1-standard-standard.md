# Attach Handlers to Container Lifecycle Events
This page shows how to attach handlers to Container lifecycle events. Kubernetes supports
the postStart and preStop events. Kubernetes sends the postStart event immediately
after a Container is started, and it sends the preStop event immediately before the
Container is terminated. A Container may specify one handler per event.
## Before you begin
You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must
be configured to communicate with your cluster. It is recommended to run this tutorial on a cluster with at least two nodes that are not acting as control plane hosts. If you do not already have a
cluster, you can create one by using
[minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tutorials/multi_node/)
or you can use one of these Kubernetes playgrounds:
* [iximiuz Labs](https://labs.iximiuz.com/playgrounds?category=kubernetes&amp;filter=all)
* [Killercoda](https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/kubernetes)
* [KodeKloud](https://kodekloud.com/public-playgrounds)
