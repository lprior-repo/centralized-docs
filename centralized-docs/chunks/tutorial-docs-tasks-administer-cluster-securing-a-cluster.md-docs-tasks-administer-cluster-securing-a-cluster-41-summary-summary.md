Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCE, etc.) often expose metadata services locally to instances.
By default these APIs are accessible by pods running on an instance and can contain cloud
credentials for that node, or provisioning data such as kubelet credentials. These credentials
can be used to escalate within the cluster or to other cloud services under the same account.
When running Kubernetes on a cloud platform, limit permissions given to instance credentials, use
[network policies](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/declare-network-policy/) to restrict pod access
to the metadata API, and avoid using provisioning data to deliver secrets.
