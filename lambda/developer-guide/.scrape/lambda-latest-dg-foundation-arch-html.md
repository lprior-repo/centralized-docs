# Selecting and configuring an instruction set architecture for your Lambda function
The *instruction set architecture* of a Lambda function determines the type of computer
processor that Lambda uses to run the function. Lambda provides a choice of instruction set architectures:
* arm64 – 64-bit ARM architecture, for the AWS Graviton2 processor.
* x86\_64 – 64-bit x86 architecture, for x86-based processors.
###### Note
The arm64 architecture is available in most AWS Regions. For more information, see [AWS Lambda Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com//lambda/pricing/#aws-element-9ccd9262-b656-4d9c-8a72-34ee6b662135). In the memory prices table, choose the **Arm Price** tab, and then open the **Region** dropdown list to see which AWS Regions support arm64 with Lambda.

## Advantages of using arm64 architecture
Lambda functions that use arm64 architecture (AWS Graviton2 processor) can achieve significantly better price
and performance than the equivalent function running on x86\_64 architecture. Consider using arm64 for
compute-intensive applications such as high-performance computing, video encoding, and simulation
workloads.
The Graviton2 CPU uses the Neoverse N1 core and supports Armv8.2 (including CRC and crypto extensions) plus
several other architectural extensions.
Graviton2 reduces memory read time by providing a larger L2 cache per vCPU, which improves the latency
performance of web and mobile backends, microservices, and data processing systems. Graviton2 also provides
improved encryption performance and supports instruction sets that improve the latency of CPU-based machine
learning inference.
For more information about AWS Graviton2, see [AWS Graviton
Processor](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton).
## Requirements for migration to arm64 architecture
When you select a Lambda function to migrate to arm64 architecture, to ensure a smooth migration, make sure
that your function meets the following requirements:
* The deployment package contains only open-source components and source code that you control, so that you
can make any necessary updates for the migration.
* If the function code includes third-party dependencies, each library or package provides an arm64
version.
## Function code compatibility with arm64 architecture
Your Lambda function code must be compatible with the instruction set architecture of the function. Before you
migrate a function to arm64 architecture, note the following points about the current function code:
* If you added your function code using the embedded code editor, your code probably runs on either architecture
without modification.
* If you uploaded your function code, you must upload new code that is compatible with your target
architecture.
* If your function uses layers, you must [check each
layer](./adding-layers.html#finding-layer-information) to ensure that it is compatible with the new architecture. If a layer is not compatible, edit
the function to replace the current layer version with a compatible layer version.
* If your function uses Lambda extensions, you must check each extension to ensure that it is compatible with
the new architecture.
* If your function uses a container image deployment package type, you must create a new container image
that is compatible with the architecture of the function.
## How to migrate to arm64 architecture
To migrate a Lambda function to the arm64 architecture, we recommend following these steps:
1. Build the list of dependencies for your application or workload. Common dependencies include:
* All the libraries and packages that the function uses.
* The tools that you use to build, deploy, and test the function, such as compilers, test suites,
continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, provisioning tools, and scripts.
* The Lambda extensions and third-party tools that you use to monitor the function in production.
* For each of the dependencies, check the version, and then check whether arm64 versions are
available.
* Build an environment to migrate your application.
* Bootstrap the application.
* Test and debug the application.
* Test the performance of the arm64 function. Compare the performance with the x86\_64 version.
* Update your infrastructure pipeline to support arm64 Lambda functions.
* Stage your deployment to production.
For example, use [alias routing configuration](./configuring-alias-routing.html) to split
traffic between the x86 and arm64 versions of the function, and compare the performance and latency.
For more information about how to create a code environment for arm64 architecture, including
language-specific information for Java, Go, .NET, and Python, see the [Getting started with AWS Graviton](https://github.com/aws/aws-graviton-getting-started) GitHub
repository.
## Configuring the instruction set architecture
You can configure the instruction set architecture for new and existing Lambda functions using the Lambda console, AWS
SDKs, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or CloudFormation. Follow these steps to change the instruction set architecture for an existing Lambda
function from the console.
1. Open the [Functions page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/functions) of the Lambda console.
2. Choose the name of the function that you want to configure the instruction set architecture for.
3. On the main **Code** tab, for the **Runtime settings** section, choose
**Edit**.
4. Under **Architecture**, choose the instruction set architecture you want your function
to use.
5. Choose **Save**.
