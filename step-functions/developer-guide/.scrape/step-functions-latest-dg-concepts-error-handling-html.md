# Handling errors in Step Functions workflows
All states, except `Pass` and `Wait` states, can encounter runtime errors. Errors can happen for various reasons, including the following:
* **State machine definition issues** - such as a Choice state without a matching rule
* **Task failures** - such as an exception in a AWS Lambda function
* **Transient issues** - such as network partition events
When a state reports an error, Step Functions defaults to failing the **entire** state machine execution. Step Functions also has more advanced error handling features. You can set up your state machine to catch errors, retry failed states, and gracefully implement error handling protocols.
Step Functions catchers are available for **Task**, **Parallel **and **Map** states, but not for
top-level state machine execution failures. To handle executions you anticipate might fail,
your caller can handle the error, or you might nest those executions inside child workflows
to catch errors inside your parent workflow. Alternatively, you might choose to listen for
`TIMED\_OUT` events from Standard workflows with an EventBridge bus and invoke an action to
handle the failed execution.
###### Practical examples for handling errors
To deploy an example of a workflow that includes error handling, see [Handling error conditions in a Step Functions
state machine](./tutorial-handling-error-conditions.html) tutorial in this guide, and [Error Handling](https://catalog.workshops.aws/stepfunctions/handling-errors) in *The AWS Step Functions Workshop*.
## Error names
Step Functions identifies errors using case-sensitive strings, known as *error
names*. The Amazon States Language defines a set of built-in strings that name well-known
errors, all beginning with the `States.` prefix.
States can report errors with other names. However, the error names cannot begin with
the `States.` prefix.
Ensure your production code can handle AWS Lambda service exceptions
(`Lambda.ServiceException` and `Lambda.SdkClientException`). For
more information, see how to [Handle transient Lambda service exceptions](./sfn-best-practices.html#bp-lambda-serviceexception) in *Best practices*.
**
`States.ALL`
**
A wildcard that matches any known error name.
The `States.ALL` error type must appear alone in a `Catcher` and cannot catch the `States.DataLimitExceeded` terminal error or `Runtime` error types.
For more information, see [States.DataLimitExceeded](#error-data-limit-exceed) and [States.Runtime](#states-runtime-error).
**
`
States.DataLimitExceeded`
**
A terminal error which cannot be caught by the `States.ALL` error type.
Reported due to the following conditions:
* Output of a connector is larger than payload size quota.
* Output of a state is larger than payload size quota.
* After `Parameters` processing, the input of a
state is larger than the payload size quota.
For more information on quotas, see [Step Functions service quotas](./service-quotas.html).
**
`States.ExceedToleratedFailureThreshold`**
A `Map` state failed because the number of failed items exceeded the threshold specified in the state machine definition. For more information, see [Setting failure thresholds for Distributed Map states in Step Functions](./state-map-distributed.html#maprun-fail-threshold).
**
`States.HeartbeatTimeout`
**
A `Task` state failed to send a heartbeat for a period longer than the `HeartbeatSeconds` value.
`HeartbeatTimeout` is available inside the `Catch` and `Retry` fields.
**
`States.Http.Socket`
**
Occurs when an HTTP task times out after 60 seconds. See [Quotas related to HTTP Task](./service-quotas.html#service-limits-http-task).
**
`States.ItemReaderFailed`**
A `Map` state failed because it couldn't read from the item source specified in the
`ItemReader` field. For more information, see `[ItemReader (Map)](./input-output-itemreader.html)`.
**
`States.Permissions`
**
A `Task` state failed because it had insufficient privileges to
run the specified code.
**
`States.ResultWriterFailed`**
A `Map` state failed because it couldn't write results to the destination specified
in the `ResultWriter` field. For more information, see
`[ResultWriter (Map)](./input-output-resultwriter.html)`.
**`
States.Runtime`**
An execution failed due to some exception that it couldn't process. Often
these are caused by errors at runtime, such as attempting to apply
`InputPath` or `OutputPath` on a null JSON
payload. A `States.Runtime` error isn't retriable, and will
always cause the execution to fail. A retry or catch on
`States.ALL` won't catch `States.Runtime`
errors.
**
`States.TaskFailed`
**
A `Task` state failed during the execution. When used in a
retry or catch, `States.TaskFailed` acts as a wildcard that
matches any known error name except for `States.Timeout`.
**
`States.Timeout`
**
Reported when a `Task` state runs longer than the `TimeoutSeconds` value or failed to send a heartbeat for a period longer than the `HeartbeatSeconds` value.
If a *nested state machine* throws a `States.Timeout`, the parent will receive a `States.TaskedFailed` error.
A `States.Timeout` error is also reported when an entire state machine execution runs longer than the specified `TimeoutSeconds` value.
###### Note
Unhandled errors in Lambda runtimes were historically reported only as `Lambda.Unknown`. In newer runtimes, timeouts are reported as `Sandbox.Timedout` in the
error output.
When Lambda exceeds the maximum number of invocations, the reported error will be `Lambda.TooManyRequestsException`.
Match on `Lambda.Unknown`, `Sandbox.Timedout`, and `States.TaskFailed` to handle possible errors. You can also use `States.ALL`, but it must be alone and at the end of the list.
For more information about Lambda `Handled` and `Unhandled` errors, see `FunctionError` in the [AWS Lambda Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_Invoke.html#API_Invoke_ResponseSyntax).
## Retrying after an error
`Task`, `Parallel`, and `Map` states can have a field named `Retry`, whose value
must be an array of objects known as *retriers*. An individual retrier represents a certain number of retries, usually at increasing time intervals.
When one of these states reports an error and there's a `Retry` field, Step Functions scans through the retriers in the order listed in the array. When the error name appears in the value of a retrier's `ErrorEquals` field, the state machine makes retry attempts as defined in the `Retry` field.
If your redriven execution reruns a [Task workflow state](./state-task.html), [Parallel workflow state](./state-parallel.html), or [Inline Map state](./state-map-inline.html), for which you have defined retries, the retry attempt count for these states is reset to 0 to allow for the maximum number of attempts on redrive. For a redriven execution, you can track individual retry attempts of these states using the console. For more information, see [Retry behavior of redriven
executions](./redrive-executions.html#redrive-retry-behavior) in [Restarting state machine executions with redrive in
Step Functions](./redrive-executions.html).
A retrier contains the following
fields:
**
`ErrorEquals` (Required)**
A non-empty array of strings that match error names. When a state reports
an error, Step Functions scans through the retriers. When the error name appears in
this array, it implements the retry policy described in this retrier.
**
`IntervalSeconds` (Optional)**
A positive integer that represents the number of seconds before the first retry
attempt (`1` by default). `IntervalSeconds` has a maximum value of 99999999.
**
`MaxAttempts` (Optional)**
A positive integer that represents the maximum number of retry attempts
(`3` by default). If the error recurs more times than
specified, retries cease and normal error handling resumes. A value of
`0` specifies that the
error
is never retried. `MaxAttempts` has a maximum value of 99999999.
**
`BackoffRate` (Optional)**
The multiplier by which the retry interval denoted by `IntervalSeconds` increases after each retry attempt. By default, the
`BackoffRate` value increases by `2.0`.
For example, say your `IntervalSeconds` is 3, `MaxAttempts` is 3, and `BackoffRate` is 2. The first retry attempt takes place three seconds after the error occurs. The second retry takes place six seconds after the first retry attempt. While the third retry takes place 12 seconds after the second retry attempt.
**
`MaxDelaySeconds` (Optional)
**
A positive integer that sets the maximum value, in seconds, up to which a retry interval can increase. This field is helpful to use with the `BackoffRate` field. The value you specify in this field limits the exponential wait times resulting from the backoff rate multiplier applied to each consecutive retry attempt. You must specify a value greater than 0 and less than 31622401 for `MaxDelaySeconds`.
If you don't specify this value, Step Functions doesn't limit the wait times between retry attempts.
**
`JitterStrategy` (Optional)
**
A string that determines whether or not to include jitter in the wait times between consecutive retry attempts. Jitter reduces simultaneous retry attempts by spreading these out over a randomized delay interval. This string accepts `FULL` or `NONE` as its values. The default value is `NONE`.
For example, say you have set `MaxAttempts` as 3, `IntervalSeconds` as 2, and `BackoffRate` as 2. The first retry attempt takes place two seconds after the error occurs. The second retry takes place four seconds after the first retry attempt and the third retry takes place eight seconds after the second retry attempt. If you set `JitterStrategy` as `FULL`, the first retry interval is randomized between 0 and 2 seconds, the second retry interval is randomized between 0 and 4 seconds, and the third retry interval is randomized between 0 and 8 seconds.
###### Note
Retries are treated as state transitions. For information about how state transitions affect billing, see [Step Functions Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/pricing/).
### Retry field examples
This section includes the following `Retry` field examples.
* [Retry with BackoffRate](#retrybackoffrate)
* [Retry with MaxDelaySeconds](#retrymaxdelayseconds)
* [Retry all errors except States.Timeout](#retrytimeout)
* [Complex retry scenario](#complexretryeg)
######
Example 1 – Retry with BackoffRate
The following example of a `Retry` makes two retry attempts with the first retry taking place after waiting for three seconds. Based on the `BackoffRate` you specify, Step Functions increases the interval between each retry until the maximum number of retry attempts is reached. In the following example, the second retry attempt starts after waiting for three seconds after the first retry.
```
`"Retry": [ {
"ErrorEquals": [ "States.Timeout" ],
"IntervalSeconds": 3,
"MaxAttempts": 2,
"BackoffRate": 1
} ]`
```
######
Example 2 – Retry with MaxDelaySeconds
The following example makes three retry attempts and limits the wait time resulting from `BackoffRate` at 5 seconds. The first retry takes place after waiting for three seconds. The second and third retry attempts take place after waiting for five seconds after the preceding retry attempt because of the maximum wait time limit set by `MaxDelaySeconds`.
```
`"Retry": [ {
"ErrorEquals": [ "States.Timeout" ],
"IntervalSeconds": 3,
"MaxAttempts": 3,
"BackoffRate":2,
"MaxDelaySeconds": 5,
"JitterStrategy": "FULL"
} ]`
```
Without `MaxDelaySeconds`, the second retry attempt would take place six seconds after the first retry, and the third retry attempt would take place 12 seconds after the second retry.
######
Example 3 – Retry all errors except States.Timeout
The reserved name `States.ALL` that appears in a retrier's `ErrorEquals` field is a wildcard that matches any error name. It must appear alone in the `ErrorEquals` array and must appear in the last retrier in the `Retry` array. The name `States.TaskFailed` also acts a wildcard and matches any error except for `States.Timeout`.
The following example of a `Retry` field retries any error except `States.Timeout`.
```
`"Retry": [ {
"ErrorEquals": [ "States.Timeout" ],
"MaxAttempts": 0
}, {
"ErrorEquals": [ "States.ALL" ]
} ]`
```
######
Example 4 – Complex retry scenario
A retrier's parameters apply across all visits to the retrier in the context of a
single-state execution.
Consider the following `Task` state.
```
`"X": {
"Type": "Task",
"Resource": "arn:aws:states:`region`:123456789012:task:X",
"Next": "Y",
"Retry": [ {
"ErrorEquals": [ "ErrorA", "ErrorB" ],
"IntervalSeconds": 1,
"BackoffRate": 2.0,
"MaxAttempts": 2
}, {
"ErrorEquals": [ "ErrorC" ],
"IntervalSeconds": 5
} ],
"Catch": [ {
"ErrorEquals": [ "States.ALL" ],
"Next": "Z"
} ]
}`
```
This task fails four times in succession, outputting these error names: `ErrorA`, `ErrorB`, `ErrorC`, and
`ErrorB`. The following occurs as a result:
* The first two errors match the first retrier and cause waits of one and two seconds.
* The third error matches the second retrier and causes a wait of five seconds.
* The fourth error also matches the first retrier. However,
it
already reached its maximum of two retries (`MaxAttempts`) for
that particular error. Therefore, that retrier fails and the execution
redirects
the workflow to the `Z` state through the
`Catch` field.
## Fallback states
`Task`,
`Map` and `Parallel` states can
each
have a field named `Catch`. This field's value must be an
array of objects, known as *catchers*.
A catcher contains the following fields.
**
`ErrorEquals` (Required)**
A non-empty array of strings that match error names, specified exactly as
they are with the retrier field of the same name.
**
`Next` (Required)**
A string that must exactly match one of the state machine's state
names.
**
`ResultPath` (JSONPath, Optional)**
A [path](./concepts-input-output-filtering.html) that
determines what input
the
catcher sends to the state specified in the
`Next` field.
When a state reports an error and either there is no `Retry` field, or if
retries fail to resolve the error, Step Functions scans through the catchers in the order listed
in the array. When the error name appears in the value of a catcher's
`ErrorEquals` field, the state machine transitions to the state named in
the `Next` field.
The reserved name `States.ALL` that appears in a catcher's
`ErrorEquals` field is a wildcard that matches any error name. It must
appear alone in the `ErrorEquals` array and must appear in the last catcher
in the `Catch` array. The name `States.TaskFailed` also acts a
wildcard and matches any error except for `States.Timeout`.
The following example of a `Catch` field transitions to the state named
`RecoveryState` when a Lambda function outputs an unhandled Java
exception. Otherwise, the field transitions to the `EndState` state.
```
`"Catch": [ {
"ErrorEquals": [ "java.lang.Exception" ],
"ResultPath": "$.error-info",
"Next": "RecoveryState"
}, {
"ErrorEquals": [ "States.ALL" ],
"Next": "EndState"
} ]`
```
###### How many errors can a catcher catch?
Each catcher can specify **multiple errors** to handle.
### Error output
When Step Functions transitions to the state specified in a catch name, the object usually
contains the field `Cause`. This field's value is a human-readable
description of the error. This object is known as the *error
output*.
In the previous JSONPath example, the first catcher contains a `ResultPath` field. This
works similarly to a `ResultPath` field in a state's top level, resulting
in two possibilities:
* Take the results of that state's execution and overwrite
either all of, or a portion of, the state's input.
* Take the results and adds them to the input. In the case of an error
handled by a catcher, the result of the state's execution is the error output.
Thus, for the first catcher in the example,
the catcher
adds the error
output
to the input as a field named `error-info`
if there
isn't already a field with this name in the
input.
Then, the
catcher sends the entire
input
to `RecoveryState`. For the second catcher, the error output overwrites
the input and
the catcher
only
sends the
error output
to
`EndState`.
For JSONPath workflows, if you don't specify the `ResultPath` field, it defaults to
`$`, which selects and overwrites the entire input.
When a state has both `Retry` and `Catch` fields, Step Functions uses
any appropriate retriers first.
If
the retry policy fails to resolve the error, Step Functions applies the
matching catcher
transition.
### Cause payloads and service
integrations
A catcher returns a string payload as an output. When working with service
integrations such as Amazon Athena or AWS CodeBuild, you may want to convert the
`Cause` string to JSON. The following example of a
`Pass`
state with intrinsic functions shows how to convert a
`Cause`
string to JSON.
```
`"Handle escaped JSON with JSONtoString": {
"Type": "Pass",
"Parameters": {
"Cause.$": "States.StringToJson($.Cause)"
},
"Next": "Pass State with Pass Processing"
},`
```
## State machine examples using Retry and Catch
The state machines defined in the following examples assume the existence of two Lambda
functions: one that always fails and one that waits long enough to allow a timeout
defined in the state machine to occur.
This is a definition of a Node.js Lambda function that always fails, returning the
message `error`. In the state machine examples that follow, this Lambda
function is named `FailFunction`. For information about creating a Lambda
function, see [Step 1: Create a Lambda
function](./tutorial-creating-lambda-state-machine.html#create-lambda-function) section.
```
`exports.handler = (event, context, callback) =&gt; {
callback("error");
};`
```
This is a definition of a Node.js Lambda function that sleeps for 10 seconds. In the state machine examples that follow, this Lambda function is named `sleep10`.
```
`exports.handler = (event, context, callback) =&gt; {
setTimeout(function(){
}, 11000);
};`
```
###### Timeout settings for the function
When you create the Lambda function for the examples, remember to set the `Timeout` value in the advanced settings to 11 seconds.
### Handling a failure
using Retry
This state machine uses a `Retry` field to retry a function that fails
and outputs the error name `HandledError`.
It retries
this
function
twice
with an exponential backoff between retries.
```
`{
"Comment": "A Hello World example invoking Lambda function",
"StartAt": "HelloWorld",
"States": {
"HelloWorld": {
"Type": "Task",
"Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:`region`:123456789012:function:FailFunction",
"Retry": [ {
"ErrorEquals": ["HandledError"],
"IntervalSeconds": 1,
"MaxAttempts": 2,
"BackoffRate": 2.0
} ],
"End": true
}
}
}`
```
This variant uses the predefined error code `States.TaskFailed`, which
matches any error that a Lambda function outputs.
```
`{
"Comment": "Hello World example which invokes a AWS Lambda function",
"StartAt": "HelloWorld",
"States": {
"HelloWorld": {
"Type": "Task",
"Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:`region`:123456789012:function:FailFunction",
"Retry": [ {
"ErrorEquals": ["States.TaskFailed"],
"IntervalSeconds": 1,
"MaxAttempts": 2,
"BackoffRate": 2.0
} ],
"End": true
}
}
}`
```
###### Best practices for handling Lambda exceptions
Tasks that reference a Lambda function should handle Lambda
service exceptions. For more information, see [Handle transient Lambda service exceptions](./sfn-best-practices.html#bp-lambda-serviceexception) in Best Practices.
### Handling a failure
using Catch
This example uses a `Catch` field. When a Lambda function outputs an
error, it
catches the error
and
the state machine transitions to the `fallback` state.
```
`{
"Comment": "Hello World example which invokes a AWS Lambda function",
"StartAt": "HelloWorld",
"States": {
"HelloWorld": {
"Type": "Task",
"Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:`region`:123456789012:function:FailFunction",
"Catch": [ {
"ErrorEquals": ["HandledError"],
"Next": "fallback"
} ],
"End": true
},
"fallback": {
"Type": "Pass",
"Result": "Hello, AWS Step Functions!",
"End": true
}
}
}`
```
This variant uses the predefined error code `States.TaskFailed`, which
matches any error that a Lambda function outputs.
```
`{
"Comment": "Hello World example which invokes a AWS Lambda function",
"StartAt": "HelloWorld",
"States": {
"HelloWorld": {
"Type": "Task",
"Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:`region`:123456789012:function:FailFunction",
"Catch": [ {
"ErrorEquals": ["States.TaskFailed"],
"Next": "fallback"
} ],
"End": true
},
"fallback": {
"Type": "Pass",
"Result": "Hello, AWS Step Functions!",
"End": true
}
}
}`
```
### Handling a timeout
using Retry
This state machine uses a `Retry` field to retry a `Task`
state that times
out,
based on the timeout value specified in `TimeoutSeconds`.
Step Functions retries
the
Lambda function invocation in this `Task` state
twice,
with an exponential backoff between retries.
```
`{
"Comment": "Hello World example which invokes a AWS Lambda function",
"StartAt": "HelloWorld",
"States": {
"HelloWorld": {
"Type": "Task",
"Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:`region`:123456789012:function:sleep10",
"TimeoutSeconds": 2,
"Retry": [ {
"ErrorEquals": ["States.Timeout"],
"IntervalSeconds": 1,
"MaxAttempts": 2,
"BackoffRate": 2.0
} ],
"End": true
}
}
}`
```
### Handling a timeout
using Catch
This example uses a `Catch` field. When a timeout occurs, the state
machine transitions to the `fallback` state.
```
`{
"Comment": "Hello World example which invokes a AWS Lambda function",
"StartAt": "HelloWorld",
"States": {
"HelloWorld": {
"Type": "Task",
"Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:`region`:123456789012:function:sleep10",
"TimeoutSeconds": 2,
"Catch": [ {
"ErrorEquals": ["States.Timeout"],
"Next": "fallback"
} ],
"End": true
},
"fallback": {
"Type": "Pass",
"Result": "Hello, AWS Step Functions!",
"End": true
}
}
}`
```
###### Preserving state input and error in JSONPath
In JSONPath, you can preserve the state input and the error by using
`ResultPath`. See [Use ResultPath to include both error and input
in a Catch](./input-output-resultpath.html#input-output-resultpath-catch).
